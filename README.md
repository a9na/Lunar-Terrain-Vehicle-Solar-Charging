# Lunar Terrain Vehicle Solar Charging Station

This project simulates a solar charging station for a Lunar Terrain Vehicle (LTV). It models the components necessary for charging the vehicle using solar power, including solar panels, a battery, a charge controller, and a monitoring system. The simulation includes more detailed models, real-time data inputs, and advanced monitoring features.

## Project Structure

- `SolarPanel`: Represents a solar panel that generates power based on sunlight intensity.
- `Battery`: Represents a battery that stores the generated power and includes efficiency and discharge rate.
- `ChargeController`: Manages the charging process of the battery.
- `MonitoringSystem`: Logs and displays detailed information about the system's performance.
